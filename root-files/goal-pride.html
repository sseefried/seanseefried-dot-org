<h2>June 2019 - More muscle mass than ever before</h2>
<p>
The DEXA scan I had in 2017 showed that I had 67.1kg of Lean mass + BMC.
1.5 years later, after training BJJ really hard, I had actually lost 2kg
of muscle mass. I started weight training again this year. The first DEXA
scan I got showed that I still only had 65.9kg of Lean mass + BMC.
However, I went really hard in the following cycle and got myself to 67.3kg!
My biceps have never been this big either at 36cm+.
